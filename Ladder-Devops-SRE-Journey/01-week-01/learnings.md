# Week 1: Key Learnings & Takeaways

| Concept | Insight | Application to My Journey |
|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| **SysAdmin → DevOps** | From *manual ops* to *automated delivery* | I used to SSH and restart PM2 — that’s SysAdmin. Now I’ll automate it. |
| **CALMS Framework** | Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing | My team lacks **measurement** — no SLOs. I’ll introduce response time tracking. |
| **SRE Error Budgets** | Allows controlled risk | I can push features faster if downtime < 0.5% per quarter. |
| **Platform Engineering** | Builds tools for developers | I want to create a “deploy button” for my team’s Next.js apps. |
| **Role Convergence** | All roles need **scripting + monitoring** | My JS/TS skills are a head start — now add Bash + Prometheus. |

## Aha Moment
> **“DevOps is not about tools. It’s about reducing friction between code and production.”**  
> — Saying

This explains why my manual deploys were painful. **Automation = speed + reliability.**
