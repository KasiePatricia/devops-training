# 🚀 Next Steps in Your DevOps Journey

Great work with your deep dive into your company's branching strategy and CI/CD infrastructure. You've built a solid map of *how* and *why* your organization's systems work — the perfect foundation for what's next.

Now that you understand the **theory**, it's time to get hands-on with the **practice**. This is where your transition into DevOps really accelerates.

## ✅ Action Items for Our Next Session

### **1. Learn Docker Fundamentals**

Start with the basics:

* What is a **container**?
* What is an **image**?
* What is the purpose of a **Dockerfile**?

Understanding these will unlock everything else that follows.

---

### **2. Dockerize a Frontend Project**

Put your new Docker knowledge into practice:

* Take a simple frontend project (React, Vue, or even static HTML/JS).
* Write a **Dockerfile** for it.
* Build and run it locally using **Docker commands only**.

This gives you hands-on experience with containerizing real applications.

---

### **3. Pick ONE New Language (Go or Python)**

Choose one of the languages we discussed and start learning the basics.
This will become your DevOps “glue” language for:

* Automation scripts
* Backend tools
* Working with APIs

**Pick one. Stick to it. Master the fundamentals.**

---

## 🕐 The 1-Hour-a-Day Habit

As we discussed, consistency beats intensity.
Commit to **1 hour a day** of learning — not more, not less.

This keeps you moving forward *without* burning out.
It’s a marathon, not a sprint. And you’ve absolutely got this. 💪
