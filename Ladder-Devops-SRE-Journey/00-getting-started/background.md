# My Career Story & Motivation

## Early Days: Discovering Tech
I grew up in Enugu, Nigeria, where access to computers was limited to cyber cafés and occasional school labs. My first real exposure came in 2022 when I started learning frontend development. The interactive HTML/CSS challenges hooked me instantly — I could type code and see a webpage change in real time. That “magic” moment sparked a passion that hasn’t faded.

## First Steps into Frontend (2022–2023)
I enrolled in a computer-science diploma program but learned more outside the classroom. I taught myself JavaScript via YouTube (Traversy Media, The Net Ninja) and built small static sites for local businesses — a restaurant menu, an e-commerce page. Each project reinforced the feedback loop: code → deploy → user smiles.

In mid-2023, I landed a remote job as software developer.

The process was slow, error-prone, and stressful. That’s when I realized **frontend alone wasn’t enough** — I needed to own the entire delivery pipeline.

## Expanding to Backend (2024)
Building on frontend skills, I started exploring backend development to create full-stack applications. I learned Node.js and Express through building APIs for my frontend projects, including user authentication, database integration with PostgreSQL, and real-time features with Socket.io. This led to contributing to an open-source ed-tech platform where I implemented RESTful services and handled data persistence.

## The Failed DevOps Bootcamp (Early 2023)
I enrolled in a 3-month DevOps bootcamp advertised on Discord Community. The curriculum looked perfect: Linux, Docker, AWS, CI/CD with GitHub Actions. I attended the first two live sessions and even set up a simple Nginx container. Then the mentor vanished — no notice, no refund. The Slack channel died. I was left with half-baked Docker knowledge and a lingering frustration.

## Professional Experience & Quiet Upskilling (2023–2025)
I doubled down on full-stack development to pay bills:
- Joined a Enugu-based fin-tech company as **Junior Software Developer** (remote), focusing on frontend.
- Led the migration of a 50-page dashboard from CRA to Next.js 13 (app router), integrating NestJS for the backend API.
- Introduced TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, and Prisma for database ORM across the team.
- Built 3 internal tools (admin panel, analytics dashboard, A/B testing UI) now used by 200+ teachers, with Docker for local development environments.

Yet every sprint retrospective highlighted the same bottleneck: **deployment delays**. The backend team used Jenkins; we used Vercel. No one understood the other’s pipeline. I started reading “The Phoenix Project” and watching Adrian Cantrill’s AWS videos at 1.5× speed, but without structure I retained little. I also experimented with Docker for containerizing Node.js apps and basic AWS EC2 instances.

## Why Ladder Tech Mentorship 5.0?
This 8-week program is my **structured reboot** into DevOps and SRE. With guidance from my mentor, Kolawole Deji (System Engineer), I want to:
- Replace manual SSH deploys with reproducible pipelines.
- Speak fluently with backend & infra engineers.
- Ship features faster without breaking production.
- Master reliability practices like monitoring and incident response.
- Eventually contribute to open-source DevOps tools (e.g., a GitHub Action for Next.js edge caching).

I’m not starting from zero — I already grasp Git, NPM, Vercel, basic Linux, Docker, and some AWS. I just need a mentor to connect the dots, review my pipelines, and show me the 20% of DevOps that solves 80% of frontend and backend pain.

**I’m ready to commit 15–20 hours/week, attend every session, and document everything publicly.** This folder is proof. Current stack includes React, Next.js, NestJS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Docker — all of which I'll leverage in my DevOps journey.
