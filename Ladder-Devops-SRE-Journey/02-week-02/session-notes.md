# Week 2: 1-on-1 Mentorship Session  
**Ladder Tech Mentorship 5.0 – Cohort 5**  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Mentor:** Kolawole Deji – *System Engineer*  
**Mentee:** Kasie Ugwu (@KasiePatricia)

---

## Session Highlights

| Topic | Key Discussion |
|-------|----------------|
| **Current Workflow Review** | Walked through Kasie’s real-world deploy flow:  
| | `git push → Vercel (frontend)` + `PM2 restart (backend on DigitalOcean)` |
| | **Pain points identified:**  
| | - No staging environment  
| | - Manual backend restarts  
| | - No automated tests in pipeline  
| | - Git used, but no formal branching strategy |
| **Gap Analysis** | Kasie knows **code → deploy**, but not **how/why** the pipeline works.  
| | Goal: **Own the full lifecycle** — from PR to production. |
