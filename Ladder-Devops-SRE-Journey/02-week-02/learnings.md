# Week 2: Key Learnings

| Insight | Source | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Git is not just `push`** | Mentor walkthrough | I now see branching as **risk management** |
| **Vercel = CI/CD for frontend** | vercel.com | My deploys are automated — but **opaque** |
| **Pipeline = contract** | Assignment 02-B | If I can’t read it, I can’t own it |
| **Feature flags > long branches** | TBD research | Enables safe rapid iteration |
